# MESOSCOPE_Repo

This repository is an unorganized collection of scripts that relate to the 2017 MESOSCOPE cruise. 

The repository includes various importing, tidying, and rearranging scripts, as well as a collection of scripts for NMDS, k-means, univariate stats, etc.
It is split into the HILIC and Reverse Phase (Cyano) runs, and includes an "Archive" folder of scripts that were used at various points of data exploration.
*Important*

The repo is UNORGANIZED; the filepaths will not always work. The code demonstrates appropriate analysis and documentation, 
but the user will need to rework the scripts so they run from beginning to end.
